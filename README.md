Writing365
==========

Write365 is a Drupal 7 module collaboration between the Writing Program, [Technology Across the Curriculum (TAC)](http://oregonstate.edu/tac/), and the [Writing Center](http://writingcenter.oregonstate.edu/) at [Oregon State University](http://oregonstate.edu/). We are all interested in helping students thrive - in their studies, personal life, and in their communities - and this project is a manifestation of that desire.
